# Auto-Push to GitHub Rule

Whenever tasks, code edits, or bug fixes are completed:
1. Verify git status and validate the codebase.
2. Stage all relevant modifications (`git add ...`).
3. Commit with a concise and descriptive message.
4. Push directly to GitHub (`git push origin main`).
5. Ensure the working tree is clean.
